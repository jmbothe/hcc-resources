If you only have time for one thing, read this:

## Tech Meetups - Baltimore and Columbia
This is just a short list of my favorites. You can find many more at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com). Take advantage of meetups to expand your professional network and improve your search for internships and jobs.

## Who to follow on Twitter
Short list of thought leaders who consistently post high-quality content on Twitter. Note that Twitter is also an AWESOME place to look for jobs. Often hiring managers will post job openings directly to twitter and say "my DMs are open". I've gotten several interviews this way. It's nice not to have to actually apply :)
